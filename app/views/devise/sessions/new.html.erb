            <p>
              Test-ify gives you the tools to easily build the test
              you want. Choose from multiple choice, true or false,
              and short answer questions. The test builder makes it
              simple to add or remove questions, change the order of
              questions, and edit older tests. Test-ify also keeps
              track of the correct answers so you never have to make
              an answer key again.

            <span>Store</span>
            <p>
              Save and store your tests in the cloud! No more searching
              file cabnets or your hard drive for that test you used
              last year. Test-ify keeps them all in one place and makes
              it easy to search for the right test. You can edit last 
              years test or automatically generate a new version of the
              same test.

            <span>Print</span>
            <p>
              Test-ify makes it easy to print your tests right from the
              browser. No more formating tab stops and indenting paragraphs
              in a text editor. Test-ify will handle all that for you! Test-ify
              will also automatically generate an answer key for you to print.
