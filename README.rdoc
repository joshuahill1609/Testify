Notes: nested_form gem requires this set-up in assest pipeline:

application.js - //= require jquery
                 //= require jquery_nested_form
                 //= require jquery_ujs

assests/javascripts - application.js (no nested_form.js or jquery_nested_form or anything else)

with out this set up the link_to_add will stop working.
